# Introduction
Shufti Pro provides two modes of verification:
1. **Real-Time Verification**
2.	**Offline Verification**

In **Real time verification**, your customer has to show their face and the required document in front of the camera. On the other hand in **Offline Verification**, you have an opportunity to provide your customer’s identity document to us via this API and we’ll send you the verification results back.

### *Real-Time Verification*
A typical real-time verification workflow looks like this:
1.  You send us your customer’s data to verify at one of our end points. We validate your request  and  send  you  a  redirect  URL  so  you  can  redirect  your  customer  to  our verification page or you can embed this in an iFrame.
2.  Your customer sees an instruction page. Upon clicking ‘Next’ , the verification process starts.
3.  Your customer shows their face followed by the required document to the camera and the verification process begins in the background.
4.  Upon verification, your customer will be redirected back to the given URL. Along with this
URL, we’ll also send you the verification response via a callback.
5.  When  you  receive  a  verification  response  from  us,  you  will  also  receive  a  field **Signature**. You need to verify this field before proceeding further. An example is given below.

### *Offline Verification*
In this mode, you only make a single call to our API with your customer’s Identity document and we send you the verification result back in response to this API call. You can provide us this identity document either as an image or you can ask your customer to provide you a recorded video which you can forward to us. So for the Offline verification you can choose following methods:

1.  Still Image Verification (Your customer’s face and document image as a Base64 String)*
2.  Video Verification (A recorded video of your customer showing his/her face and identity document (details showing clearly in the camera))** <br>

*&nbsp; Base64 string size shouldn’t be greater than 4MB for each image <br>
** This video size shouldn’t be greater than 8MB

# Identity Verification
The Identity verification supports the following kinds of verification:
*   General Purpose verification
*   Driving license verification
*   Passport verification
*   ID Card verification

### *General Purpose*
Your customer is provided with a list of verification methods to choose from such as passport, driving license or ID card. After the user chooses one particular verification type, they are requested to display the required document in front of the camera. The validity of this document will make sure after cross checking the information provided in the request with that in the document

### *Driving License*
Your customer needs to display their Driving License. Shufti Pro verifies the validity of the driving license by cross checking the information (customer’s name and date of birth) provided in the request with that in the driving license.

### *Passport*
Your customer needs to display their passport. The validity of the passport is verified by cross checking the provided information with that in the passport. For example, the customer’s name and date of birth are cross checked to make sure whether the passport shown is forged or authentic.

### *ID Card*
Your customer needs to display their Identity Document. It could be government, school and/or university issued ID card. Shufti Pro verifies the validity of such ID card by cross checking the information (customer name and date of birth) provided in the request with that in the ID card.

#  Get Request status
To get the request status later after verification you may use this endpoint. To get the request status you are required to send the client_id, reference and signature in POST request. The reference is your unique request **reference** which you send at the time of request. Calculate the signature as described in signature calculation section. If all the validation passed and your request is found in our record then you will get back the verification status of request which is associated with the reference you are providing. <br>

**Endpoint:**  	POST https://api.shuftipro.com/status <br>
**Format:**	    x-www-form-urlencoded

| Parameter | Required | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| client_id | Yes | Client’s ID provided by Shufti Pro to you. (ID must be in alphanumeric format) |
| reference | Yes | Your unique request reference which you have send at the time of request. (a valid request reference which is associated with  any request at the time of request) |
| signature | Yes | Concat request values as client_id, reference and secret_key, then calculate SHA256 hash of all values. |

Find sample codes under this section.

# Responses
The Shufti Pro API will send you two types of responses. First is the HTTP response sent against your request, and the second is the callback response, respectively. Both HTTP and callback responses will be in the JSON format and they will contain the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| status_code | One of the status codes from the status codes section. |
| message | The description of status code. If the status code is **SP2** then the message will be a redirect URL. |
| reference | Your unique request reference which was provided at the time of request so that you can identify the response in relation to request made. |
| signature | The **SHA256** hash of all response parameters. The process of signature calculation is given in the response signature calculation section. |

> **Note:** Callback response will be sent on the callback_url provided in the request **provided** the provided callback URL is a valid URL.

# Status Codes
Status codes represent the status of the verification process (Success / Failure). The Shufti Pro Verification API uses the following status codes sent throughout when making any kind of verification request.

| Status Code | Description | HTTP | Callback |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| SP0 | Not Verified | Yes | Yes |
| SP1 | Verified | Yes | Yes |
| SP2 | Success! -- Contains the redirect url in message parameter. | Yes | Yes |

# Signature Calculation
The request and response signature can be calculated as following: 
### *Request Signature*
1.  Sort all the request parameters (keys) in (ascending alphabetical order) 
and concatenate them.
2.  Append the secret key in the end.
3. Calculate the SHA256 hash of string (made in above 2  steps)

### *Response Signature*
1.  Decode the response from JSON format.
2.  Get all the response parameters’ values and concatenate them.
3.  Append the secret key in the end
4.  Calculate the SHA256 hash of the string (made in above 2  steps).

So for example if you have 3 following parameters and your secret key is **Trump**: <br>
```
first_name:	Alex 
last_name:	John 
dob:		1990-12-25 
You’d calculate its signature as 
SHA256 (“1990-12-25AlexJohnTrump”) = ea617383129f67037f369d2bc66c7e44a3690ddcf93f52128d828fdf3cab2b2c
```
Please note here, parameters are sorted ascendingly by their keys  as  **d**ob, **f**irst_name and **l**ast_name and then Secret Key at the end.
